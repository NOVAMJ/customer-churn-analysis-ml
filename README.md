##  Overview
Customer churn is a critical business metric. This project explores historical customer data to:  
- Predict churn using ML classification models  
- Identify key churn factors  
- Provide actionable recommendations for retention

- **Records:** ~7,000 customer entries  
- **Features:**  
  - Demographics (gender, senior citizen, partner)  
  - Subscription details (contract type, tenure, monthly charges)  
  - Services used (internet, streaming, phone)  
  - Target: `Churn (Yes/No)`  

---

##  Tools & Technologies
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, SHAP

##  Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Handled missing values in `TotalCharges`  
- Encoded categorical features  
- Normalized numerical variables  
- Created tenure-based customer segments

---

##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Higher churn observed among customers with:  
  - Month-to-month contracts  
  - High monthly charges  
  - No tech support/online security services  
- Tenure and contract type strongly influence churn risk

---

##  Modeling
- Models tested: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, k-nearest neighbors, Support Vector Machine, XGBoost and Gradient Boosting
- Best Model: **Gradient Boosting** (~86% accuracy)  
- SHAP used for feature importance and explainability  

---

##  Key Findings & Result
- **Top churn drivers:**  
  - Contract type (Month-to-Month)  
  - High monthly charges  
  - Low tenure customers  
- Customers with longer contracts churn less  
- Bundled service offers can help reduce churn
